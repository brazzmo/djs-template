//You MUST name the file EXACTLY what the event is. For example if you want a onGuildMemberAdd event, you would make a file (in /events) called onGuildMemberAdd.js
//Client MUST be the first argument in the function:

module.exports = (client, /**Arguments required in event here ->*/) => {
    //Code for event here.
}
